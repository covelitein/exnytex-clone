            <h3>2. RISK WARNING</h3>
            <p>
              2.1 Buying, selling and investing in cryptocurrencies can be
              risky. The risk of loss in trading or holding cryptocurrency can
              be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether
              trading or holding cryptocurrency is suitable for you in light of
              your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold
              cryptocurrency, you should be aware that the price or value of
              cryptocurrency can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even
              fall to zero.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.2 The cryptocurrencies market information relating to the past
              performance of an investment is not necessarily a guide to its
              performance in the future. The value of investments or income from
              them may go down as well as up. Like stocks and shares as well,
              cryptocurrencies are valued from second to second, their bid and
              offer value fluctuates sometimes widely. The degrees of
              fluctuation of prices vary significantly and the value of higher
              volatility funds may change suddenly. The value of investments may
              rise or fall due to the volatility of world markets, interest
              rates and capital values or, for investments held in overseas
              markets, changes in the rate of exchange in the currency in which
              the investments are denominated. You may not necessarily get back
              the amount you invested.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.3 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading also has
              certain risks which can cause a complete loss to zero. As
              cryptocurrencies are no official currency and the legal status is
              still undefined, their legal nature is subject of change under
              different jurisdictions. Unlike official currencies, which are
              backed up by governments or other legal entities like the FED, ECB
              or others, cryptocurrencies are a private currency, generated by
              all the world. There is no central bank that could take corrective
              measures to protect the value of the cryptocurrencies at a
              possible crisis.
            </p>
            <p>
              2.4 You know and understand cryptocurrency trading could be
              affected by hackers, change of laws, official restrictions,
              frauds, technical issues, collapse of infrastructure and many
              other possible threats.

              for trading cryptocurrencies. Your decisions and investments are

            <h3>7. FEES</h3>
            <p>
              7.1 External fees. Every cryptocurrency transaction must be added

              transfer. The work of validating transactions and adding them to
              the blockchain is done by miners, which are powerful computers
              that make up a portion of the network and confirm its
              transactions. Miners spend vast amounts of computing power and
              energy doing this for a financial reward: with every block (a
              collection of transactions) added to the blockchain comes a bounty
              called a block reward, as well as all fees sent with the
              transactions that were confirmed and included in the block. For
              this reason, miners have a financial incentive to prioritize the
              validation of transactions that include a higher fee. For someone
              looking to send funds and get a quick confirmation, the
              appropriate fee to include depends on the cryptocurrency being
              sent and can vary greatly, depending on a number of factors, such
              as transaction size and network conditions. Your wallet will
              automatically calculate the appropriate fee for sending your
              chosen cryptocurrency. The fee for sending ether is static (you
              can view the fee for sending ether by clicking “Send” and
              selecting Ether as the currency), while the fees for sending
              bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and stellar are dynamic and will be
              calculated by your wallet after you input the amount you want to
              send. This article explains bitcoin transaction fees in greater
              detail.

            <h3>10. TRANSACTIONS ON CRYPTOCURRENCY NETWORKS</h3>
            <p>
              10.1 When you use your Exnytex Account to send or receive
              cryptocurrency, the transaction must be confirmed and recorded in
              the public ledger associated with the relevant cryptocurrency
              network (e.g. the Bitcoin network or the Ethereum network). That
              cryptocurrency network is solely responsible for verifying and
              confirming any such transactions. Exnytex cannot confirm, cancel
              or reverse transactions on a cryptocurrency network, other than
              confirming to you that the network has completed the transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.2 Once submitted to a cryptocurrency network, a transaction
              will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient
              confirmation of the transaction by the network. A transaction is
              not complete while it is in a pending state. Funds associated with
              transactions that are in a pending state will be designated
              accordingly, and will not be included in your Exnytex Wallet
              balance or be available to you to conduct transactions; When you
              send cryptocurrency from your Exnytex Account, you are authorising
              us to submit your transaction request to the relevant
              cryptocurrency network. Once a transaction request has been
              submitted to the relevant cryptocurrency network, the network will
              automatically complete or reject the request and neither you or
              Exnytex will be able to cancel or otherwise modify your
              transaction. Cryptocurrency networks are operated by decentralised
              networks of independent third parties. They are not owned,
              controlled or operated by Exnytex so we cannot ensure that any
              transaction details you submit will be confirmed by the relevant
              cryptocurrency network. You agree that any transaction details you
              submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by
              the cryptocurrency network used to process the transaction.

              10.3 SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE THAT: Exnytex is not responsible
              for the operation of any cryptocurrency network’s underlying
              software protocols and makes no guarantee as to their
              availability, security, or functionality; the underlying software
              protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known
              as “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value,
              function, and/or name of any cryptocurrency you store in your
              Exnytex Account. Should a fork occur, Exnytex may, with or without
              notice to you, temporarily suspend our operations and, in our sole
              discretion, decide whether or not to support either branch of the
              forked protocol entirely; in the event Exnytex decides not to
              support a branch of a forked protocol, you will not be given
              access to the assets on that fork. Those assets will be securely
              held by Exnytex and we will not buy or sell them.

              of the site if no violations will be detected within 14 days. User
              who is a citizen of the Russian Federation agrees that due to the

              circumvention of Exnytex'S controls, including but not limited to
              opening multiple Exnytex Accounts; we reasonably suspect your
              involvement in any attempt to gain unauthorised access to any
              Exnytex Account; your Exnytex Account is or appears to be the
              subject of any legal, regulatory or government process and/or we,
              in our sole discretion, consider there to be a heightened risk of
              legal or regulatory non-compliance associated with your Exnytex
              Account; we are compelled to do so by a prima facie valid
              subpoena, court order, or other binding order of a government or
              regulatory authority; your name appears on a government or
              international body sanctions list.

              notice of any decision to restrict, suspend or terminate your
              Exnytex Account, unless we are prevented from doing so by any
              legal or regulatory process or requirement, or where doing so may
              compromise Exnytex’s security and/or risk management procedures.
              You accept and agree that Exnytex is under no obligation to
              disclose to you the fact of or reason for any decision to

              where legally obligated not to) return your available
              cryptocurrency and/or Local Currency balances to you pursuant to
              the procedure set out below: Cryptocurrency. If you have an
              available balance of Supported Cryptocurrency in your Exnytex
              Account above the Minimum Threshold, we will liquidate the
              cryptocurrency and deposit the value realised from the liquidation
              into your Local Currency wallet. The Minimum Threshold is
              USD10.00, or its equivalent in any applicable Supported
              Cryptocurrency calculated on the day on which the liquidation is
              performed. We will not send your Supported Cryptocurrency to an
              alternative cryptocurrency wallet address. Any risk of a negative
              exchange rate fluctuation shall rest with you and you shall have
              no claim against Exnytex for any losses you may suffer as a result
              of the liquidation of your available balance of Supported
              Cryptocurrency.

              other affiliates (including their respective directors, members,
              employees or agents) be liable to you for any direct, indirect,
              special, consequential, exemplary or punitive damages or any other
              damages of any kind, including but not limited to loss of profit,
              loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of opportunity, loss of
              data, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or in

              unavailability of the Exnytex Site and/or your Exnytex Account,
              including without limitation any damages caused by or resulting
              from any reliance upon any information received from Exnytex, or
              that result from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of
              files or email, errors, defects, viruses, delays in operation or
              transmission or any failure of performance, whether or not
              resulting from a force majeure event, communications failure,
              theft, destruction or unauthorised access to Exnytex’s records,
              programmes or services.

              claim or dispute that arises in relation to the Exnytex Site, your
              Exnytex Account or these Terms, within 30 days of such claim or
              dispute arising. You and we further agree to attempt informal
              resolution of any Dispute prior to bringing a claim in any court
              or other body.
            </p>
            <p>
              18.2 Governing law and jurisdiction. This agreement shall be
              governed by and construed in accordance with Malta law, subject to
              any local mandatory rights you may have. You and we agree to
              submit all disputes, claims or controversies (including

              or in connection with these Terms, or the breach, termination,
              enforcement or interpretation thereof (together, Disputes), to the

              proceeding against the other. Further, where permissible by law,
              unless both you and Exnytex agree otherwise, no court may
              consolidate any other person’s claim(s) with your Dispute, and may
              not otherwise preside over any form of representative or class
              proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              18.4 For the avoidance of doubt, if this Class or representative
              action waiver is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to
              be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Disputes
              clause shall remain valid and enforceable.
